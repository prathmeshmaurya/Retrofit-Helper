# Retrofit-Helper
Reference repo for GET, POST, PUT, PATCH &amp; DELETE request using Retrofit.
Retrofit is a type-safe REST client for Android and Java. It makes it easy to consume RESTful Web Services in your apps.
It is an abstraction layer over HTTP calls and leverages okHTTP as networking layer.

Some important features of Retrofit are : 
1. It is type-safe - Means that it avoids (takes care of) errors due to type mismatch between values received in your data object
    (JSON/XML/YML) and the types of your (Java) object in which you will be storing it in your app.
2. Generates the low level networking calls automatically. Only an interface containing the methods to be implemented needs to be created 
   with proper annotations, the implementation is generated by Retrofit.
